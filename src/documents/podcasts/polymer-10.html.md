Polymer 1.0 is here! Lean mean and production ready. On episode 46 we talk to a Proverbial Packed Panel of Professional
Polymer People. Polymer has grown a ton since its developer preview and has been streamlined for performance.
A big show where we talk to a panel of both GDEâ€™s and members of the Polymer team to get a better idea of just how this
project has grown and why Polymer and web components as a whole are important for the modern and future web platform.
